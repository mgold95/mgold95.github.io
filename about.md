Hi there. 

I'm Michael Goldstein, a 22-year-old FPGA Engineer at Akuna Capital,
a Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering student at the Georgia Institute of Technology,
and a Computer Engineering alumnus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 

I've worked on a variety of side projects in my free time and have interned with [Akuna Capital][1], a 
proprietary trading firm based in Chicago, since March of 2014. Initially, I worked in C# as a 
desktop developer creating a proprietary trading application. In summer of 2016, I interned as a
hardware engineer developing pieces of the trading engine. I will be joining Akuna for the beginning
of my full-time career late June as a hardware & software engineer working on Akuna's trading engine. 
For more information about my side projects and professional experience, please see
my [GitHub profile][2], my [StackOverflow profile][3], my 
[LinkedIn profile][5], or [email me][4] to ask for my resume.

My academic and professional interests include systems & embedded programming, hardware engineering and design, 
and computer security.

Other things of particular interest to me include statistics, history, music, and politics.

I spend a great deal of my time reading (all sorts of things like FiveThirtyEight to the Wall Street Journal,
to classics like The Count of Monte Cristo, to nonfiction works and textbooks).
Some other hobbies include running, playing acoustic
guitar and singing, working on various side projects, writing, playing any sports (since living in Chicago
I've grown particularly fond of beach volleyball and tennis), and following baseball.

Thanks for visiting.

-- Michael
