Hi there. 

I'm Michael Goldstein, a 21-year-old Computer Engineering senior at the University of 
Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. 

I've worked on a variety of side projects in my free time and have interned with [Akuna Capital][1], a 
proprietary trading firm based in Chicago, since March of 2013. Initially, I worked in C# as a 
desktop developer creating a proprietary trading application. Last summer, I worked as a
hardware engineer developing pieces of the trading engine. I will be joining Akuna for the beginning
of my full-time career next summer as a Hardware & Software Engineer. For more information about my side 
projects and professional experience, please see
my [GitHub profile][2], my [StackOverflow profile][3], my 
[LinkedIn profile][5], or [email me][4] to ask for my resume.

My academic and professional interests include systems programming, computer security and 
cryptography, hardware engineering and design, and real-time computing.

Other things of particular interest to me include statistics, history, music, and politics.

I spend a great deal of my time reading (all sorts of things like FiveThirtyEight to the Wall Street Journal,
to classics like The Count of Monte Cristo, to nonfiction works and textbooks).
Some other hobbies include playing acoustic
guitar and singing, working on various side projects, writing, playing any sports (since living in Chicago
I've grown particularly fond of beach volleyball and tennis), and following baseball.

Thanks for visiting.

-- Michael
