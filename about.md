Hi there. 

I'm Michael Goldstein, an FPGA Engineer at Akuna Capital,
a MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering alumnus of the Georgia Institute of Technology,
and a BS in Computer Engineering alumnus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 

I've worked on a variety of side projects in my free time and have worked for [Akuna Capital][1], a 
proprietary trading firm based in Chicago, since March of 2014. My focus at Akuna has been 
using FPGAs to build low-latency trading systems.
For more information about my side projects and professional experience, please contact me via email, michael@,
or [via LinkedIn][2].

My academic and professional interests include financial markets, telecommunications, systems & embedded programming,
hardware engineering and design, and computer security.

Other things of particular interest to me include economics, statistics, history, and music.

Some various hobbies of mine include volunteering with [Crisis Text Line][3], [chess][4], cooking, running,
reading, playing acoustic guitar and singing, writing, and playing mostly any sport.

Thanks for visiting.

-- Michael
