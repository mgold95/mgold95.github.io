Hi there. 

I'm Michael Goldstien, a 21-year-old Computer Engineering senior at the University of 
Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. 

I've worked on a variety of side projects in my free time and have interned with [Akuna Capital][1], a 
proprietary trading firm based in Chicago, since March of 2013. Initially, I worked in C# as a 
desktop developer creating a proprietary trading application. Last summer, I worked as a
hardware engineer developing pieces of the trading engine. I will be joining Akuna for the beginning
of my full-time career next summer as a Hardware & Software Engineer. For more information on my side 
projects and professional experience, please see my [resume][0], 
my [GitHub profile][2], my [StackOverflow profile][3], my [StackOverflow Careers CV][4], or my 
[LinkedIn profile][5].

My academic and professional interests include systems programming, computer security and 
cryptography, hardware engineering and design, and real-time computing.

Other things of particular interest to me include statistics, history, music, and politics.

I spend a great deal of my time reading (all sorts of things like FiveThirtyEight to the Wall Street Journal,
to classics like The Count of Monte Cristo, to nonfiction works and textbooks).
Some other hobbies include playing acoustic
guitar and singing, working on various side projects, writing, playing any sports (since living in Chicago
I've grown particularly fond of beach volleyball and tennis), and following baseball.

My blog has no real direction. It's not really a professional portfolio. It's not really geared towards
any one topic. I just write about what I feel like and hopefully you enjoy reading it. 

Thanks for visiting.

-- Michael
