G'day. I'm Michael Goldstien, a 21-year-old Computer Engineering senior at the University of 
Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. 

I've worked on a variety of side projects in my free time and have interned with Akuna Capital, a 
proprietary trading firm based in Chicago, since March of 2013. Initially, I worked in C# as a 
desktop developer creating a proprietary trading application. This summer, I am working as a
hardware engineer developing pieces of the trading engine. For more information on my side 
projects and professional experience, please see my [resume][0], my [projects page][1], 
my [GitHub profile][2], my [StackOverflow profile][3], my [StackOverflow Careers CV][4], or my 
[LinkedIn profile][5].

My academic and professional interests include systems engineering, computer security and 
cryptography, hardware engineering and design, and real-time computing.

Other things of particular interest to me include statistics, history, music, and politics.

My hobbies include reading (mostly classical novels and non-fiction), playing acoustic
guitar, writing, working on various side projects, playing any sports (since living in Chicago
I've grown particularly fond of beach volleyball and tennis), and following baseball.

I hope you enjoy reading my blog; thanks for visiting.

-- Michael
