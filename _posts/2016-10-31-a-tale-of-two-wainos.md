# Background

Can small, seemingly irrelevant discrepancies between pitches be the difference
that causes a pitcher to have a great outing instead of a poor one?

Adam Wainwright was once one of the most dominant pitchers in the game of
baseball. In 2016, however, Waino seemed unable to return to his former
dominant self after suffering a [season-ending achilles tear in 2015](http://m.mlb.com/news/article/120854420/st-louis-cardinals-pitcher-adam-wainwright-tears-achilles-will-miss-9-12-months/){:target="_blank"}. I'm going 
to compare two of Wainright's starts this season -- one
dominant outing and one poor outing -- and analyze what caused Adam's success 
in the former and failure in the latter. What I'm not going to do is look too hard for
things like mechanical differences in Wainwright's delivery. The purpose of
this analysis isn't to figure out "what's wrong with Wainwright", but rather
to emperically look at the differences in the pitches.

# The Games

I chose to compare Wainwright's outings on May 12 and July 16. On May 12,
Wainwright pitched 5 innings giving up 11 hits and 7 runs to the Angels lineup. 
The St. Louis Post
Dispatch commented, "The start was not what the Cardinals or Adam Wainwright
desired."[^1] It really wasn't all that unusual though. Wainwright really struggled
at the beggining of the season and by June he had posted an ERA of 5.71.[^2]
Throughout June and July Wainwright put up pretty good numbers before a 
mediocre end of the season. 

July 16 was in the middle of Wainwright being
"on his game" this season. It was his best start of the year. He had a complete
game 3-hitter shutout. He really looked like the dominant Wainwright of the
past. The Marlins lineup was just not at all able to read his pitches. 

What made the Adam Wainwright of July 16 so dominant while the Wainwright of
May 12 was simply ineffective? Well, in the words of Cardinals Manager Mike
Matheny, "The art of tonight was him taking off a little bit of velocity,
putting on a little movement, and all, all about location."[^3] Let's directly
compare the numbers and see how much of what Matheny said was right.

# Methodology

MLB Advanced Media has a system installed in every ballpark called [PITCHf/x](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PITCHf/x){:target="_blank"}. Using
mounted cameras and advanced algorithms, they track things like the release point,
release velocity, spin rate, spin direction, break, pitch type, and more for every
pitch in the MLB. The great thing is they actually release [all of this data in XML](http://gd2.mlb.com/components/game/mlb/){:target="_blank"} on 
their website, free for public use. It provides people everywhere with the data
they need to perform statistical analysis of baseball.

I downloaded the XML list of all pitches for each game. I then wrote two separate python
scripts. One parses any given type of pitch from the XML and creates a spray plot of
the locations color coded by the outcome. The second script parses any given type of pitch
and outputs some statistics on the pitch like how often it's thrown, velocity, and break.

Both scripts also attempt to correct for error in pitch classifications since the data
seemed to have many fastballs and sinkers incorrectly classified as cutters.

Both scripts, their output figures and stats, and the input XML data are all [available
on my github](https://github.com/mgold95/baseball){:target="_blank"}.

# Velocity and Movement

First, let's look at some stats side-to-side for Adam Wainwright's sinkers.

```
_______________________________________________________________________________
| Sinkers -- 7/16/16                   | Sinkers -- 5/12/16                   |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 26 thrown, 21.666667% of all pitches | 28 thrown, 32.558140% of all pitches |
| Velocity:                            | Velocity:                            |
|     Mean:         89.373077          |     Mean:         90.328571          |
|     Std. Dev:     1.946310           |     Std. Dev:     1.476206           |
| Break Length:                        | Break Length:                        |
|     Mean:         6.403846           |     Mean:         5.550000           |
|     Std. Dev:     0.563970           |     Std. Dev:     0.849159           |
| Break Angle:                         | Break Angle:                         |
|     Mean:         29.800000          |     Mean:         32.017857          |
|     Std. Dev:     5.394442           |     Std. Dev:     3.201680           |
|______________________________________|______________________________________|
```

We don't see too much of a difference there. During the bad start, Adam averaged
about 1mph faster and he had a bit more lateral movement while sacrificing a bit
of break. I don't think there's anything too significant between the two.

Next, let's look at four-seam fastballs.

```
_______________________________________________________________________________
| Four-seam Fastballs -- 7/16/16       | Four-seam Fastballs -- 5/12/16       |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 30 thrown, 25.000000% of all pitches | 8 thrown, 9.302326% of all pitches   |
| Velocity:                            | Velocity:                            |
|     Mean:         88.873333          |     Mean:         89.562500          |
|     Std. Dev:     1.777439           |     Std. Dev:     1.052304           |
| Break Length:                        | Break Length:                        |
|     Mean:         5.013333           |     Mean:         4.925000           |
|     Std. Dev:     0.494458           |     Std. Dev:     0.519013           |
| Break Angle:                         | Break Angle:                         |
|     Mean:         17.900000          |     Mean:         23.150000          |
|     Std. Dev:     4.378736           |     Std. Dev:     4.983473           |
|______________________________________|______________________________________|
```

Again, I don't think anything is too different here. The break angle is once
again a bit more lateral during the bad start, but other than that, everything
is nearly identical.

Once again, with the curveballs there's nothing too different besides the break
angle, which is still more lateral.

```

I think the cutter is the pitch Mike was talking about. The velocity is down a
full 3mph in the good start versus the bad start, but the pitch had dramatically
more movement. Also, the movement was almost twice as downward versus the cutters of
Adam's bad start. 

I think it's apparent that during his dominant start on July 16, Wainwright threw
with a higher arm slot than he did during his bad start on May 12. The result was
less lateral movement but more aggressive downward movement for the cutter, sinker,
and curveball. Also, as Mike Matheny said, Wainwright sacrificed a bit of velocity
in exchange for more movement -- especially on his cutter which almost looked more
like a slider.

# Location

For each game, I created plots of the locations of the four most common pitches in 
Wainwright's repertoire, the sinker, the cutter, the fastball, and the 
curveball. The strike zone shown is the average strike zone for all of the 
players on the opposing team that game (it turns out the Angels lineup was a bit
shorter than the Marlins). Pitches that were balls are colored blue. Any good 
outcome for a pitch (called strike, swinging strike, foul, non-RBI in-play out) 
is highlighted red. Any bad outcome for a pitch (the player got a hit or runs
scored) is highlighted black. Note this highlighting scheme may be a bit too
generous to the pitcher: a 350ft flyout probably has more to do with good luck
than good pitching, for example. Also, note that even though walks are a bad 
thing, I am simply highlighting them in the ball color, blue, so it's easier 
to see exactly which pitches batters hit. 

First, let's look at Wainwright's most thrown pitch: the sinker. The first 
graph is of the locations during his bad outing and the second is during 
his good outing.

![Adam Wainwright Sinker Locations 5/12/16](/assets/waino/bad_si_loc.png)
![Adam Wainwright Sinker Locations 7/16/16](/assets/waino/good_si_loc.png)

At first glance, the location of the sinker really doesn't look any better in 
Adam's good start. If anything, it's worse since there's more around the top of
the strike zone. This starts to make a little more sense when we look at 
Wainwright's four-seam fastballs.

![Adam Wainwright Fastball Locations 5/12/16](/assets/waino/bad_ff_loc.png)
![Adam Wainwright Fastball Locations 7/16/16](/assets/waino/good_ff_loc.png)

As you can see, during the good start, Waino threw a **lot** more fastballs. The 
proportion of four-seamers thrown on July 16 was 25.0%; on May 12 it was only 9.3%!
Sinkers are really also fastballs. They're a different *type* of fastball, 
sometimes called a two-seam fastball. 
Normal fastballs, four-seam fastballs, are given their name because all four
seams of the baseball cut the air. This gives the ball more lift and makes the 
ball not drop off at the end. Some really good four-seam fastballs may even
appear to the batter to rise a bit during their flight. Sinkers are thrown
so that not all four seams cut the air. They will initially look like a normal
fastball, but because they have less lift, they will drop off towards the end
of their trajectory. This tends to induce a lot of ground balls. 

Although Adam Wainwright varies him arm slots some, he tends to throw from 
mostly a 3/4 arm slot. From that arm slot (and most others), four-seam
fastballs and sinkers both will break inside a bit. From the batter's point of
view, the two pitches may appear very similar until the last split-second.
At that point, a four-seam fastball will stay level while a sinker will drop 
off because the seams cutting the air provide much less lift. In other words,
by throwing more fastballs, Wainwright's sinker is more effective, even though the 
location isn't any better. When batters see more four-seam fastballs, they swing 
on top of the sinkers and groundout because they cannot adjust to the drop-off
of the sinker without often swinging under a four-seam fastball.

Now let's have a look at the curveballs. 
![Adam Wainwright Curveball Locations 5/12/16](/assets/waino/bad_cu_loc.png)
![Adam Wainwright Curveball Locations 7/16/16](/assets/waino/good_cu_loc.png)
Wainwright is known for having a devasting curveball. It's consistently been
one of his best pitches and he's even had outings where he relied heavily on it
when his fastball command was off. The difference between the locations of Adam's
curveballs in the good versus the bad start is very pronounced. In the good start,
almost all of the curveballs are low and away, out of the strike zone. These are the
types of pitches that a batter not looking for a curveball would be made to
look stupid by. He would see a ball traveling straight, think fastball and
start swinging, only to realize too late that the ball is taking a noze dive out of the
strike zone and that his bat is going to miss by about two feet.  

During the bad start, most of Wainwright's curveballs were in the strikezone. 
The strikezone, is a dangerous place for curveballs to be -- leave one hanging
to a batter who guesses you're going to throw it and they'll probably hit it about
a million feet. Wainwright probably would have fared quite a bit better May 12 had
he been able to keep the curveball low.

Finally, let's compare Wainwright's cutter locations for the bad outing versus the good 
outing. 
![Adam Wainwright Cutter Locations 5/12/16](/assets/waino/bad_fc_loc.png)
![Adam Wainwright Cutter Locations 7/16/16](/assets/waino/good_fc_loc.png)
As you can see, for the good outing, there is a cluster of pitches low and 
away, which is probably what Yadi called for most of the time. 
For the bad outing, more pitches seem to be up and away or just 
plain low. Too low, and a batter might tell that the pitch is going to be 
a ball and not swing. Too high and the batter could step in, reach out, and
make strong contact. Certainly, if you look at a few of the bad outcome pitch 
locations, you can see that there are pitches in similar locations on the
good outing, so maybe Wainwright got lucky a few times. Still, most of his 
cutters have much better location. These graphs really exemplify how small
differences in pitch location can make the difference in whether a cutter
gets smacked the other way for a double, or whether results in a whiff
strike three.

Without good command of his pitches, especially the softer ones like the curveball and
cutter, batters were very much able to make strong contact off Wainwright.

When Waino places his cutter in the right spot, it should look something
like this.

# Conclusion

There's quite a few differences that are noticable between the dominant Wainwright
of July 16 and the ineffective Wainwright of May 12. As Matheny noted, the dominant
Wainwright sacrificed some velocity for movement. Also, he threw with a more overhead
arm slot which resulted in less lateral movement and more vertical movement. Wainwright
threw far more four-seam fastballs which, in turn, made his sinker a more effective pitch.
He also had better command of his pitches, especially the curveball.

Of the four things named, three of them are a result of pitching "choices" rather
than simply being "on your game." Perhaps now that Wainwright has turned 35, he 
should try to beat the batter with movement instead of velocity. It certainly 
seemed to work on July 16. Also, throwing more fastballs seems to make Wainwright's
sinker do better against batters, even if it's not placed perfectly. 
Finally, Wainwright seems to have better luck from an arm slot closer to overhead 
versus 3/4. 

The sample size here is small. It's just one game being compared to another. But
it shows that Wainwright can still be one of the most dominant pitchers in the
game of baseball. It illustrates that the differences between a great start
and a poor start are more than just luck. 2017 is almost here. As a lifelong
Cardinals fan, let's hope Waino proves to be his July 16 self throughout next
season.
